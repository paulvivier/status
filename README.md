Current status on my work

## Sept 25, 2025 - Overcast morning
Color added to Miss Martha silhouette and I may be learning to spell silhouette. Painting is simple enough that this is going quickly. Hope to finish with details today. Have approval from property manager to go paint a vacant floor in the Wells Fargo tower. Schedule TBD.


## Sept 24, 2025 - Day after the rapture
Today I am working on adding color to the underpainting that I've started of the Miss Martha shrimp boat. This is a silhouetted profile view as the boat sits at the dock in the Appalachicola bay.

Awaiting responses on permission to paint the Rockydale quarry in South Roanoke and from inside the Wells Fargo tower in downtown Roanoke. Am reading "The Rock Book" and developing a fascination with the Roanoke Typewriter Sales Company.
