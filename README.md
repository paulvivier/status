Current status on my work

## Sept 24, 2025 - Day after the rapture
Today I am working on adding color to the underpainting that I've started of the Miss Martha shrimp boat. This is a silhouetted profile view as the boat sits at the dock in the Appalachicola bay.

Awaiting responses on permission to paint the Rockydale quarry in South Roanoke and from inside the Wells Fargo tower in downtown Roanoke. Am reading "The Rock Book" and developing a fascination with the Roanoke Typewriter Sales Company.
