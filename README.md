### Oct 14, 2025 - Recuperate
Kind of wore me out a bit to stand all day and draw at the tower. Was planning on doing a second day but after the first, I think I'm good. I took a lot of pictures and got a really good lay-of-the-land. Today, I'll be studying the picture and the charcoal sketches that I made. Gardened a little, split up a (20lb?) ball of Fern Peonies and replanted.

### Oct 13, 2025 - Happy Bank Holiday
Miss Ella Sue shrimp boat gets some attention today. Preparing my supplies for tomorrow's on-site visit.

### Oct 12, 2025 - Yard Rules
Cleaned up some garden beds in preparation for winter today. Yep, that's it. And I'm tired.

### Oct 11, 2025 - Saturday? Everyday is a workday as an artist
Another day to work and observe. I'm starting the day making some labels for my new/old hobby: Rockhounding (aka rock collecting). I'll write an essay about that at some point. Greenhouse is holding steady at 15 degrees above outside temp, which is good enough for October when it gets down to 45F. It buys me some time. Painting Miss Ella Sue shrimp boat today. I'm also gathering supplies for my visit to the Wells Fargo Tower on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. I'm trying to figure out how to go about painting an extremely complex, highly detailed, and vast landscape. I may have to plan on doing a few of these.

### Oct 10, 2025 - The uncertainty of Nature
Plastic is up in the greenhouse in places, but the thermostat is busted now. Luckily the temp didn't get too low last night (47F). One of the challenges with building a greenhouse is the live testing. It's hard to simulate the various temperature and moisture conditions so you just have to pay attention and respond. I like this, though. I feel like it puts me more in touch with nature. I need to paint today. Really need to paint.

### Oct 9, 2025 - Nature prioritizes itself
Mowing the grass and putting plastic up in The Greenhouse today. It got down to 50F inside the greenhouse with an outside temp of 40F. Not very insulated.

### Oct 8, 2025 - Finish the refinish
Buffet table refinish. Remember: wipe tung oil off before it has a chance to dry. use clean rags. Need to paint ...

### Oct 7, 2025 - You've got to set them up.
Met with property manager of Well Fargo Tower and will be painting the views from there soon. Very exciting. Amazing view of everything in downtown Roanoke. Dropped off two paintings to be framed with Lindor. Getting ready to cut some foam insulation in the shape of corrugated roofing with my handy new foam cutter. SO excited about that. There may be a sculpture in the future out of foam (as if there isn't enough plastic residue in this world).

### Oct 6, 2025 - Race to Finish furniture
New request in: Finish refinishing the bar. Prioritize. Installed weather trim in greenhouse on 8 windows. Better progress.

humanity has perfected the exploitation of the earths resources. now we are fine tuning the exploitation of humans, by making a profit from our attention. advertising is merely corporate propaganda.


### Oct 5, 2025 - PJs Birthday
Ripped a bunch of trim strips but only managed to seal up two and a half windows. Also managed to ram my head into an open window giving me a perfect cut right in the middle of my forehead. Old guy scar. Back at it today. Also unvarnished large shrimp boat. Now need to varnish so I can get framed Mon or Tues.

### Oct 4, 2025 - Sealing cracks
Finished yet another iteration of my coffee cup on Italian bags, adding acrylic transfers of receipts. The greenhouse was able to maintain a temp of about 60 degrees, even though I set it for 70. Time to seal up the cracks around ... everything. Need to revarnish large boat painting, I accidentally touched it while still wet and can't fix, so I have to remove and add again.

### Oct 3, 2025 - Start your day with a walk
After my poor performance on the Read Mountain hike (1000 ft?) I decided that I needed to hike more. So, I walked up Mill Mountain from the Yellowstone side today. Good incline in the beginning. Paintings varnished, but still needs some touchup. Working on refinishing furniture today.

### Oct 2, 2025 - Fall is on its way
It got down to 50 degrees last night, the time has come to close up the larger holes in the greenhouse. Color started on Miss Ella Sue shrimp boat, might add some more today. Also pasted up a layer of receipts to "Italian Coffee" multi-media collage/drawing. May glue them down today. But first, on to the greenhouse!

### Oct 1, 2025
Fix some issues with my website and aws access. Finish silhouette of Miss Martha. Start color of Miss Ella Sue. Prepare greenhouse for cold snap.

### Sept 30, 2025
Hiked up [Read Mountain](https://myhikes.org/trails/read-mountain-preserve-hike) and trying out Gemini AI for DnD [Documenting it in Github](https://paulvivier.github.io/DnD/)

### Sept 29, 2025 - still waiting for the storm
Did some yardwork. Yardwork = gardenwork. Gardenwork = gym work. People that pay for gym memberships should buy a shovel and a rake. Skip the leaf blower and get a rake.


### Sept 27, 2025 - Storms a brewin'
Completed underpainting of Miss Ella Sue shrimp boat. Mowed grass and edged. Working on adding lines to silhouette of Miss Martha. Need to give Wolf a bath. Should also probably test generator, or at least unpack it.

Quoted by Karen Armstrong in an interview: ["Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting The Banks of the Wye During a Tour - July 13, 1798 - Wordsworth "](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9622/9622-h/9622-h.htm#poem23)


### Sept 26, 2025 - Lovely morning for a walk
Letting Miss Martha dry today so I can apply lines w/o worry of smudging. While drying, I'm going to starting on an underpainting of Miss Ella Sue shrimp boat. Very complex picture, so I'm interested to see how this will turn out. Will I dive into the details, or edit the complexity out? Listening to an audiobook of Karen Armstrong's "The Battle for God: History of Fundamentalism". I was trying to find an audiobook of her other book "The History of God", but this seems close enough.

### Sept 25, 2025 - Overcast morning
Color added to Miss Martha silhouette and I may be learning to spell silhouette. Painting is simple enough that this is going quickly. Hope to finish with details today. Have approval from property manager to go paint a vacant floor in the Wells Fargo tower. Schedule TBD.


### Sept 24, 2025 - Day after the rapture
Today I am working on adding color to the underpainting that I've started of the Miss Martha shrimp boat. This is a silhouetted profile view as the boat sits at the dock in the Apalachicola bay.

Awaiting responses on permission to paint the Rockydale quarry in South Roanoke and from inside the Wells Fargo tower in downtown Roanoke. Am reading "The Rock Book" and developing a fascination with the Roanoke Typewriter Sales Company.
