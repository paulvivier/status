Hiked up Read Mountain and trying out Gemini AI for DnD

### Sept 29, 2025 - still waiting for the storm
Did some yardwork. Yardwork = gardenwork. Gardenwork = gym work. People that pay for gym memberships should buy a shovel and a rake. Skip the leaf blower and get a rake.


### Sept 27, 2025 - Storms a brewin'
Completed underpainting of Miss Ella Sue shrimp boat. Mowed grass and edged. Working on adding lines to silhouette of Miss Martha. Need to give Wolf a bath. Should also probably test generator, or at least unpack it.

Quoted by Karen Armstrong in an interview: ["Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting The Banks of the Wye During a Tour - July 13, 1798 - Wordsworth "](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9622/9622-h/9622-h.htm#poem23)


### Sept 26, 2025 - Lovely morning for a walk
Letting Miss Martha dry today so I can apply lines w/o worry of smudging. While drying, I'm going to starting on an underpainting of Miss Ella Sue shrimp boat. Very complex picture, so I'm interested to see how this will turn out. Will I dive into the details, or edit the complexity out? Listening to an audiobook of Karen Armstrong's "The Battle for God: History of Fundamentalism". I was trying to find an audiobook of her other book "The History of God", but this seems close enough.

### Sept 25, 2025 - Overcast morning
Color added to Miss Martha silhouette and I may be learning to spell silhouette. Painting is simple enough that this is going quickly. Hope to finish with details today. Have approval from property manager to go paint a vacant floor in the Wells Fargo tower. Schedule TBD.


### Sept 24, 2025 - Day after the rapture
Today I am working on adding color to the underpainting that I've started of the Miss Martha shrimp boat. This is a silhouetted profile view as the boat sits at the dock in the Apalachicola bay.

Awaiting responses on permission to paint the Rockydale quarry in South Roanoke and from inside the Wells Fargo tower in downtown Roanoke. Am reading "The Rock Book" and developing a fascination with the Roanoke Typewriter Sales Company.
